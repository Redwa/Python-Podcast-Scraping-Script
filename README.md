# Python-Podcast-Scraping-Script
Scrapes, and downloads mp3's from the Talk Python To Me website

This is a script that scrapes the website for ALL mp3 episodes, written in Python

Dependencies:
--------------
* Python 3
* requests package

Use:
-----
* Save the Python script into a directory you want the mp3s to save to.
* Open a terminal and navigate to the folder.
* Run: python episodes.py
* OR...open the script in an editor (IDLE or your preferred choice) and execute from there.
* If your not sure which script is which, open one up and read the comments at the top of the file.


Background:
------------
So if you haven't already, you should check out their website - it is called "Talk Python To Me" and does weekly podcasts/episodes talking about Python, and includes guest from all areas within the Python community. They are amazing.

Heres the link to the main page:
https://talkpython.fm/

The episodes are freely available as mp3 downloads.

I emailed the show, saying I was learning about Python and web-based stuff, and asked Michael Kennedy if he could point me in the right direction with something. I asked if it was possible to use Python to scrape the website for ALL episodes....86 of them

Amazingly he emailed me back with a script, which was aimed at a section of the site with 3  episodes on...and he gave me a hint towards getting it to grab ALL 86 episodes....it was just a case of editing the url.

So I want to put this up for others, I am going to include the 1st version (from Michael Kennedy) that grabs 3 episodes, and also my edited version to grab them all.

Note:
------
If you run the script to grab them ALL, you will need about 4.4 GB of space fo store them all. Each podcast/mp3 is an hour long.

I hope this helps - and gets used, its a single script to download EVERY episode! Awesome!
